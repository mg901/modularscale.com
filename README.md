# [modularscale](http://modularscale.com/)

### Running locally

Modular Scale is a static site built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) are required for the following installation. If you are using a Mac, you already have Ruby installed.

1. Clone the repo
2. In the terminal, `cd` into the directory
3. Run `bundle install` in terminal
4. Run `bundle exec middleman` in terminal
5. Visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567/)

From now on, you can skip #1 and #3.

To build the app, run `bundle exec middleman build` and it will generate a `build` directory.

## Conduct

We strive to create a welcoming place here for collaboration, ideas, and support. We can’t build the community we want without your help and understanding. In an effort to ensure this is a safe place for the community, we will not hesitate to remove comments that go against the guidelines and block people who are repeat offenders of the guidelines.

1. Be nice
  - Do not trash talk anyone for ideas, concepts, or things they use.
  - Do not trash talk anyone for personal beliefs, race, background, gender, or any other personal aspect of their lives.
  - Do not trash talk anyone, period.
  - Do not rip on this project, this project’s dependencies, or any other project. You may not like something, but there are methods of critique that don’t involve devaluing people’s work.
2. This project is built and maintained in free time. Be considerate that this is a labor of love. While we gladly accept feedback and feature requests, please understand the following:
  - A timeline for fixes and features will be at the maintainers’ discretion.
  - Priority of fixes and features will be at the maintainers’ discretion.
  - Scope for new features is at the maintainers’ discretion.

The guidelines are interpreted and enforced by @scottkellum and @tbrown. It is under our sole discretion to make decisions regarding enforcement of this code.
